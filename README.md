The project is a vacuum cleaner robot that is made using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. We make use of 3 ultrasonic sensors, to detect obstacles at the front, right and left sides of the robot, and 1 infrared sensor pointed downwards to prevent the robot from falling down stairs.
The Code is written in C language and compiled using MikroC.
